## Image bufferring implementation for "smooth animation"
## Parallax effect demonstration (in progress)

* parallax in progress yet..
* images buffering is implemented by loading of each picture to invisible canvas objects, that dynamically allocated
* project uses minimal gems (3 gems) - any ruby/rails configuration should be appropriated.. just in case, I use Rails 4.2.5 with ruby 2.3.0 now.



== Using

    $ git clone git clone https://github.com/vitalyp/parallax.git
    $ cd parallax
    $ bundle
    $ rails s

# *Congratulations!*
